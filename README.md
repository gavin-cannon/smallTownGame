# Overview

I am trying to explore different technologies to become a better more well rounded software developer.

This is a basic top down 2d rpg with object interaction. For now use WASD to move your character around. The goal at this juncture is to move the rock onto the red switch which will remove the laser door allowing you to get the jewel.

I want to learn the Godot game engine both to add to my technical abilities, and also to learn game development something I have wanted to do for many years.
